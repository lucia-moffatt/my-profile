		<h2>Experiences</h2>
			<p>I participated as a casual worker at a privately owned business, Kiwelli Kennels, to gain experience in the workforce and work alongside business owners to learn managerial skills required to run a successful business. I also continually worked to enhance <strong>communication skills </strong> through communicating with customers and other employees at the pet establishment. I was also able to reinforce my <strong>teamwork skills </strong>as well as working independently at a young age.
